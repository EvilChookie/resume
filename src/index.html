                I'm Dave!</h1>

            <p>If you're reading this, chances are I'm looking for a role. Let's do something awesome!</p>

            <h2>Allow myself to introduce ... myself</h2>

            <p>I'm pretty comfortable with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>. My knowledge of web technologies has come invaulable in working with web
                based applications, such as Jira and Confluence.
            </p>

            <p>For the more modern front end things, I've done work in <strong>React</strong> and
                <strong>Svelte</strong>. Right now, I'm building a self-hosted application, <a
                    href="https://github.com/EvilChookie/ShowMyCards">ShowMyCards</a>, for sorting and
                storing my Magic collection. It's done in React (using the <a href="https://create.t3.gg">T3 Stack</a> -
                Next.JS, TRPC, Prisma and Tailwind)
            </p>

            <p>I recently put together a quick <a href="https://lands.chookie.space/">Magic utility</a> for checking the
                math behind a mana base. You can see the code <a
                    href="https://github.com/EvilChookie/land-checker/">here</a>; it's using SvelteKit and hosted on
                CloudFlare Pages.</p>

            <p>If you're interested, you can see the <a href="https://github.com/EvilChookie/resume">source</a> for this
                resume, or the <a
                    href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-resume-chookie-space/sszn1r2vxa">Lighthouse
                    Report</a>.</p>

            <p>I can work with back end technologies as well - I've done work in <strong>PHP</strong>,
                <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. There's also been a
                little <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>Kotlin</strong> (but not a lot).
